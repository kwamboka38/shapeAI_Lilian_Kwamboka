  <br>I got to have hands on experience on:
  <li>HTML
  <li>JavaScript
    <li>Node.js
      <li>Express.js
        <br>during these seven days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming canlearn.
        I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:www.shapeai.tech
